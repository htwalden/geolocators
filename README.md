# geolocators
Repository for a geolocator script with python and Google API. 

The geolocator uses geopy to take in a pandas dataframe with address columns that need to be geolocated. 

The Google Geolocator API is used to derive the lat/lon data, then the output is put into a pandas DataFrame. This geolocator was developed to solve a problem during the Food Bank Link2Feed project.
